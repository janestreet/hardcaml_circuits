(** Create the update logic for a lfsr.  Used in conjuction with [reg_fb] to construct
    a complete [lfsr].

    - Shift register sizes can be between 2 and 168 bits.
    - [Galois] or [Fibonacci] forms are supported - prefer [Galois] in general as it has a
      shorter critical path.
    - The basic gate can be [xor] or [xnor].  With [xor] the all 0's state is invalid
      while with [xnor] the all 1's state is invalid.
    - The lfsrs generated are complete according to xapp052 - this means they will
      sequence through all possible states (except the invalid one) before repeating.
    - All complete lfsr have a counterpart organisation of the taps which leads to
      a second (but still complete) sequence. *)
