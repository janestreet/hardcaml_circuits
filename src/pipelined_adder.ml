(* Creates an architecture that looks like

   {v

   |  reg  |   +   |  reg |
   |   +   |  reg  |  reg |
   v}

   Each adder is of size [part_width+1] and sums 3 operands (the third being a carry in
   bit). The adders are registered in the above diagram.

   The architecture requires a lot of registers for pipelining. Not providing clear should
   help to pack the register pipelines into SRLs.
