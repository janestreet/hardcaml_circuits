  (* Bitonic sort.

     A bitonic sequence is one which changes at most twice.  The following are all
     bitonic:

     0001110
     1110011
     0001111
     1111111

     The bitonic merge operation takes a bitonic sequence and produces 2 new sequences
     of half the size each.  Both are bitonic, and all elements in the 1st sequence
     are less than or equal to all elements in the 2nd sequence.  This is performed
     recursively until the base case of 1 element which is trivially sorted.  Coming back
     up the recursion the halves are concatenated and the result is thus fully sorted.

     The bitonic sort procedure takes an unsorted list in, divides it into 2 and recurses
     to the base case.  The lower half is sorted in ascending order, while the upper half
     is sorted in descending order.  Concatentation of these lists leads to a bitonic
     sequence that can be fully sorted with the bitonic merge operation. *)

  (* Odd-even merge sort

     Consider a sequence whose first half and second half are sorted.  Now take the even
     and odd indices to make two new sequences of half the size.  Both of these new
     sequences will also be made up of two sorted halves.

     The base case of 2 elements is trivially sorted with a compare.  As we come back up
     the recursion the even and odd elements are now sorted (by induction).  The merge
     operation will take these two sequences and apply compares between indices [i, i+1]
     for all [1,3,5,...,n-3].  The trick to note is that the odd sequence can only have
     2 more 1's than the even elements (that is, at this step, no more than 1 swap will
     actually be performed). *)

  let odd_even l =
    let rec loop l e o =
      match l with
      | [] -> e, o
      | e' :: o' :: t -> loop t (e' :: e) (o' :: o)
      | _ -> failwith "expecting even length list"
    in

    | o1 :: ot, e2 :: et ->
      let { min; max } = compare_and_swap o1 e2 in
      min :: max :: compare_list ot et
    | _ -> failwith "compare list failed"

         The operation in (d) is clearly a correct sort.  The shape of (b) and the comment
         "the right column can have at most two more 1's that the left" is the key thing
         to why this works. *)
