# hardcaml_circuits

This library contains various hardware circuits which are considered useful or
instructive but which do not belong in a more specific library.

It should only depend on hardcaml (and the ppx and simulation libraries) so it
is easy for other libraries to use these components.

We also maintain a synthesis reporting tool for important circuits in this
library. This is useful for characterising circuits with different size /
performance tradeoffs.
